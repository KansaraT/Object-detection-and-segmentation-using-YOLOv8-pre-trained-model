# Object-detection-and-segmentation-using-YOLOv8-pre-trained-model

Ultralytics YOLOv8 is a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that builds upon the success of previous YOLO versions and introduces new features and improvements to further boost performance and flexibility. YOLOv8 is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and instance segmentation.

**Model**\
A Yolov8 pre-trained model (YOLOv8n) was used to detect and segment objects. 

**Project Setup**\
In the local environment do the following:

* Install the requirements\
pip install ultralytics

* Run main.py with the image link \
python main.py
